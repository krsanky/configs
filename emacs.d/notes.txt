-----------------

The Emacs way to remove the word one is inside of to press M-backspace
followed by M-d. That will kill the word at point and save it to
kill ring (as one unit).

If the cursor is at the beginning or after the end of the word,
only one of the two is sufficient. An Emacs user will typically
move between words using commands such as forward-word (M-f) and
backward-word (M-b), so they will be at the word boundary to begin
with and thus rarely need to kill the word from the inside.
